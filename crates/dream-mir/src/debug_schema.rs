//! The runtime-type schema shared by both sides of the `.dbg.json` debug source map: the writer
//! ([`dream_mir::backend::wasm::debug_map`], built into every configuration of the compiler) and the reader
//! ([`crate::execution::debugger::sourcemap`], native-only — it drives the wasmtime-based debug
//! adapter). Both walked-and-decoded the same structural description of a runtime type (struct
//! fields, union variants, array element/stride, scalar encoding) from two independently
//! hand-maintained copies; this module is the single definition they now share.
//!
//! Deliberately dependency-free (no `serde`): the writer side must keep building in every build
//! configuration, including ones without the `native` feature (and its `serde_json` dependency)
//! enabled. Each side still owns its own serialization: the writer hand-renders compact JSON
//! (see `debug_map::type_to_json`) and the reader parses `serde_json::Value` (see
//! `sourcemap::parse_type`) — only the schema these mirror is unified here.
