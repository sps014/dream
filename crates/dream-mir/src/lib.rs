//! The Mid-level IR (MIR): a control-flow graph of basic blocks with explicit, low-level
//! operations.
//!
//! Where HIR keeps structured control flow, MIR desugars everything (if/while/for/foreach/switch/
//! match/ternary/`&&`/`||`/async) into blocks joined by [`Terminator`]s. Reference-counting
//! (`Retain`/`Release`) and allocation are explicit [`Statement`]s, which lets the optimization
//! passes reason about them with ordinary dataflow. The backend  reconstructs
//! structured WASM control flow from this CFG via a relooper.
