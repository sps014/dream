# Design note: purging `T?` in favor of `Option<T>`

This is a decision record, not a tutorial. It exists to settle three questions *before* touching
the ~50-file blast radius of removing `TyKind::Nullable` (see
[07 — Adding a Feature](./07-adding-a-language-feature.md) for the general shape of a
pipeline-wide change, and the redundancy-audit plan for the full file inventory). Once these three
decisions are accepted, `removal-nullable-implementation` is mechanical: delete `TyKind::Nullable`
and its ~5 core `TypeInterner` methods, then follow the compiler errors through every `strip_nullable`
call site.

## 1. What does `null` become?

**Decision: the `null` literal is removed from the language entirely.** `None` (the existing
`Option<T>` variant constructor) becomes the sole way to spell "no value."

Rationale: keeping `null` as sugar for `Option.None` would recreate exactly the redundancy this
purge exists to remove — two spellings (`null`, `None`) for one concept, which is the same
complaint leveled at `Int32`/`int` and `Array<T>`/`List<T>` elsewhere in the audit. A language that
just deleted its second collection type and its second primitive-naming system should not grow a
second "absence" literal to replace the one it removed.

Concretely:
- The `null` keyword/token is deleted from the lexer and parser (`crates/dream-syntax`), not just
  its type. `Type::Nullable(Void)`/`is_null_literal` in `src/types/compat.rs` and the parser's
  null-literal production (`crates/dream-syntax/src/parser/expressions.rs`) go away together.
- Every former `T?` field/variable becomes `Option<T>`, initialized with `None` and read via
  `switch`/`.unwrap_or(...)`/`.is_some()` — the same API the stdlib's `Map`/`List` already expose,
  per the audit's confirmation that stdlib internals never used `T?` in the first place.
- Class fields that were `T?` with an implicit "defaults to null" now must be explicit:
  `field: Option<T> = None;` (no implicit default-initialization gap — this is a small, deliberate
  strictness increase, not a regression, since implicit-null fields are exactly the class of bug
  `Option<T>` exists to prevent).

## 2. Is `??` repurposed for `Option<T>`, or does it disappear?

**Decision: `??` is repurposed as sugar for `Option<T>.unwrap_or(...)`, not removed.**

`expr ?? default` type-checks when `expr : Option<T>` and `default : T`, and lowers directly to
`expr.unwrap_or(default)` at HIR-emission time (a pure desugaring, same tier as the existing
`$"..."` → `+`-chain sugar) rather than as a new MIR shape. This keeps the ergonomic win `??`
already provided (a short-circuiting default expression, useful inline in the middle of a larger
expression where a `switch` statement can't go) without inventing a second, competing "unwrap with
default" spelling next to `.unwrap_or(...)`.

Why not drop `??` outright and force `.unwrap_or(...)` everywhere: `.unwrap_or` already exists,
so `??` becomes *pure* sugar with zero new semantics once it targets `Option<T>` — a defensible
"two spellings, one obviously sugar for the other" case, the same category the audit explicitly
waved through for implicit/explicit interface upcasts (Part 1, "intentional flexibility"). This is
different from the `null`-vs-`None` case above because `??`/`.unwrap_or` are an operator/method
pair, not two ways to construct the same *value*.

Mechanically, this changes `??`'s lowering (`src/mir/lower/expr.rs`) from "type-check against
`Type::Nullable`, lower to a MIR comparison against `Const::Null`" to "type-check the LHS as
`Option<T>`, lower to the same call-`unwrap_or` MIR shape the method call itself already produces."
No new MIR node; the analyzer just picks a different desugaring target.

## 3. How is `Option<StructType>` boxing cost handled?

**Original decision (superseded below): accept the cost, with a flagged follow-up.** `Option<T>`
kept its one representation (heap tag + payload, discriminated union) for every `T`, including
value structs, on the theory that re-deriving `is_nullable_boxed_value`'s null-pointer-as-boxed
trick for `Option<StructType>` would reintroduce exactly the two-representations bifurcation this
purge exists to remove. `Option<Node>` where `Node` is a `class` was unaffected (a class instance
is already a heap pointer, so the tag+pointer payload is no pricier than a nullable pointer). The
cost was isolated to `Option<S>` for value-type `S`: a zero-allocation nullable slot became a
heap-allocated union.

**Superseding decision: value unions close this gap without reopening the purge.** Every
discriminated union whose payloads are *all* value types (primitives or other value structs/unions
— never a class/interface/array/string reference) is stored inline as a tag + widest-payload slot,
not heap-boxed; `Option<T>` for value-type `T` falls out of this rule for free, since it is exactly
such a union. This was the general mechanism the note above deferred to "a self-contained
follow-up," but it landed as a property of unions generally rather than an `Option`-specific
codegen path — no `TyKind::Nullable`-shaped bifurcation was reintroduced, because the rule is keyed
on payload-type shape (`is_value_type`), not on `Option` being a special case.

Any number of non-self-referential reference-typed fields is also permitted inline when the union
is explicitly annotated `@stack` (see [Enums & unions](../reference/language/enums-unions.md)):
this exists for payload shapes like a `Span<T>`/array-backed variant that need reference fields
alongside value fields, without forcing a fully boxed union. `Option<T>` itself never needs this —
`None` carries no payload and `Some(T)` carries exactly one value-typed field — so the ordinary
(non-`@stack`) value-union rule already covers it.

Net effect: `Option<StructType>` now costs the same as `StructType?` did before the purge — a
null-checkable inline slot, zero heap allocation — closing the one deliberate regression this note
originally accepted.

**Second superseding decision (Aug 2026): niche unions for single-reference payloads.** The
remaining shape — exactly two variants, one empty, one carrying a *single reference-typed*
payload (`Option<Class>`, `Option<string>`) — is now represented as the payload pointer itself
(`None` = null, `Some(x)` = `x`). This is still not an `Option`-specific path (the rule is
structural: variant/payload shape), so the no-bifurcation principle holds; it is a third
representation class beside value unions, keyed per monomorphized `TypeId`
(`TypeInterner::mark_niche_union`). It eliminates the last per-edge taxes on optional
references: the envelope allocation and its retain/release pair. `weak` fields typed
`Option<Class>` store the raw pointer and are reset to null by the weak registry on referent
death (registry kind 2), which is simpler than the boxed scheme they previously required.

## Net effect on migration

With these three decisions fixed, `removal-nullable-implementation` reduces to:

1. Delete the `null` token/literal and `TyKind::Nullable` plus its interner methods
   (`nullable()`, `strip_nullable()`, `unwrap_nullable()`, `is_nullable_boxed_value()`).
2. Follow every compile error at each `strip_nullable`/`Type::Nullable` call site (~25 files under
   `src/semantics/analyzer/**`, plus MIR/codegen: `src/mir/lower/expr.rs`,
   `emitter/rvalue/casts.rs`, `emitter/value_struct.rs`, `release.rs`, `valuetype.rs`,
   `wasm_types.rs`, `js_marshal.rs`, `js_abi.rs`, and `tooling/dream-lsp/src/index/model.rs`) and
   either delete the nullable-specific branch (if `Option<T>` already handles it structurally) or
   retarget it at `Option<T>`'s existing discriminated-union path.
3. Rewrite the `??` lowering to target `Option<T>.unwrap_or` as described above.
4. ~~Migrate every `T?`/`null` fixture and doc page to `Option<T>`/`None`/`.unwrap_or(...)`.~~ **Done** (fixtures + user/compiler docs; this note remains as the decision record).
