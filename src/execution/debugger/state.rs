//! host hooks call into this state on whichever thread they run. Each execution thread is surfaced to
//! the client as a DAP *thread* with its own [`ThreadState`] (call stack, run mode, pause flags, and
//! decoded-variable snapshot); breakpoints are shared. When a hook decides to pause it snapshots that
//! thread's frame, marks the thread paused, and blocks on the shared condvar until the main thread
//! (servicing the client's per-thread `continue`/`next`/... requests) releases it.
