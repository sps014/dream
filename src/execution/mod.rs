//! Native execution of compiled Dream modules under wasmtime. [`wasm_runner`] instantiates a `.wat`
//! / `.wasm` / `.cwasm` module, wires the `env` print imports and the [`host`] function modules
//! (file/http/regex/console/datetime/math), and runs its entry point; [`host`] holds those host
//! functions and the linear-memory marshaling they share. The browser/Node hosts mirror the same
//! function names in `runtime/dream.js`, so a program behaves identically across runtimes.
